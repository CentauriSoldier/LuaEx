- Classes now have an *optional* static constructor using the class name as the static method name.
- **Dox** comment blocks can now use internal anchor links (*#*) to other FQXNs.
- **Dox** output back navigation.
- **Dox** now uses **prism.js** for displaying code blocks with syntax highlighting for all available **prism.js** languages.
- "Copy" (to clipboard) button to all user-created code blocks in **Dox** HTML output.
- **Code** ***BlockTag*** to Dox, permitting code examples with any user-specified **prism.js** language.
- **Example** ***BlockTag*** now automatically detects the **prism.js** language based on the **Dox** subclass being used.
- Relevant **prism.js** scripts are automatically added to **Dox's** finalized HTML output based on the languages used in the documentation.
- **Dox** **Parsers** (subclasses) for several new languages.

### Changed
- Moved the changelog from README.md to its own file.
- Modified the changelog to be more in line with [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) standards.
- Consolidated the old **class** changelog (*in the module's documentation*) into **LuaEx's** changelog.
- Appropriate class-level check functions now intuitively return the class object where expected but only when the class is in scope, nil otherwise.
- Classes now fully respect polymorphism in assignment operation type checking.
- The class constructor may now be either private, protected or public.
- The **class** module now interally handles all serialization and deserialization via the serializer system.
- **class** constructor must now accept a string (*authenitication code*) as its second argument to be used with the ***class.isstaticconstructorrunning*** function. This can now determine whether the static constructor is currently running.
- **enum** items now have ***__eq*** and ***__lt*** metamethods.
- **Dox** now auto-combines certain multiple built-in ***BlockTag*** items such as **Param**, **Return**, etc. into a single section.
- ***DoxBlockTags*** can now be set to *combined* which places all items using that tag into one section.
- **Dox** now has an ***@inheritdoc*** tag that allows inheritance of docs from one **fqxn** to another.
- **Dox** Fully Qualified Dox Names (**fqxn**) may now contain spaces.
- **Dox** now allows custom intro page message.
- Subclassing is now able to be limited to certain subclass types by providing either a blacklist or whitelist.
- **DoxBuilderHTML** now places all output into a single HTML file instead of using a separate *.js* file.
- **Dox** CSS redesigned to be more functional, readable and aesthetically pleasing.
- **DoxBlockTag** column wrappers are now defined by each **DoxBuilder** subclass rather than globally.

### Fixed
- The **class** static constructor not executing correctly.
- The **class** system not permitting **Lua/LuaEx** keywords to be used as member names when using directives.
- **CoG** not allowing recursive access to *config* table.
- **Dox** displaying parameters, returns and other combined tags out of order.
- **class** kits not adopting parents' protected and public read-only values.
- **Structfactory** not properly cloning itself.
- **Structs** not properly cloning internal objects.
- Instance returns in parent class were not properly returning child instance when subclassed.

Note: *Use the **rawtype** function to ignore all **LuaEx** type mechanics*.
