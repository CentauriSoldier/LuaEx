Variables are prefixed with the following symbols based on their type/application.

b	|	boolean
c	|	class
e	|	enum
f	| 	function
h	|	file\window\etc. handle (number)
n	|	number
o	|	class/other (object)
p	|	file/dir path (string)
r	|	struct
s	|	string
t	|	table
u	| 	userdata
v	|	variable/unknowm type
z	|	type (string) (e.g., "string", "table", etc.)

Types ignored by this convention are types nil and null since prefixing such a variable type would, generally, serve no real purpose.

Exceptions:
In for loops, sometimes 'x' is used to indicate active index while 'k' and 'v' are used (when using pairs/ipairs) to reference the key and value of a table respectively. This shorthand is used often when the purpose and process of the loop is self-evident or easily determined at a glance.
